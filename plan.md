# Project Plan: Azure Cosmos Database Visualizer

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a user interface (UI) application that allows users to interact with an Azure Cosmos Database graphically, presenting the data as a diagram rather than just a list of JSON documents. The application will have both frontend and backend components. The backend will be developed in Golang, while the frontend will be developed using React and TypeScript. The entire application will be containerized for easy deployment across various operating systems.

## Features
1. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to ensure secure access to the application.
2. **Graphical Representation**: Display the Azure Cosmos Database data in a graphical format, allowing users to visualize relationships between entities.
3. **Interactive Diagram**: Enable users to interact with the diagram, such as zooming, panning, and clicking on nodes to view details.
4. **CRUD Operations**: Allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data through the graphical interface.
5. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature to help users quickly find specific entities within the database.
6. **Data Filtering**: Enable users to filter the displayed data based on various criteria.
7. **Real-time Updates**: Provide real-time updates to the diagram when changes occur in the database.
8. **Containerization**: Containerize the application using Docker to ensure easy deployment and scalability.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Golang
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Setup and Authentication
- Setup project structure and version control (GitHub).
- Implement user authentication system.
- Dockerize backend and frontend.

### Milestone 2: Data Visualization
- Establish connection with Azure Cosmos DB.
- Fetch and display data graphically.
- Implement basic diagram interactions (zoom, pan).

### Milestone 3: CRUD Operations and Search
- Enable CRUD operations through the UI.
- Implement search functionality.
- Ensure data integrity and consistency.

### Milestone 4: Enhancements and Testing
- Add advanced features like filtering and real-time updates.
- Conduct thorough testing of the application.
- Address any bugs or performance issues.

### Milestone 5: Documentation and Deployment
- Write comprehensive documentation for setup, configuration, and usage.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Azure, AWS, Google Cloud).

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Setup and Authentication
- **Week 3-4**: Data Visualization
- **Week 5-6**: CRUD Operations and Search
- **Week 7-8**: Enhancements and Testing
- **Week 9-10**: Documentation and Deployment

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Technical Challenges**: Potential difficulties in integrating with Azure Cosmos DB. Mitigation: Conduct thorough research and utilize available documentation and support resources.
- **Timeline Delays**: Unforeseen issues leading to delays in project completion. Mitigation: Regularly review progress, communicate effectively within the team, and adjust timelines as necessary.

## Conclusion
The Azure Cosmos Database Visualizer project aims to provide users with an intuitive graphical interface for interacting with Azure Cosmos DB data. By following the outlined plan, we aim to deliver a robust and user-friendly application that meets the requirements and expectations of our stakeholders.
